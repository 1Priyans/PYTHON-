__Properties = '''The purpose of Looping OR Iterative Or Repetative Statements is that " To Perform certain Operation Repeatedly OR 
                  Iteratively for Finite Number of Times until Test Condition becomes False."

    1. while loop   OR  while..else loop
    2. for loop   OR   for ..else Loop

    b) Conditional Part ( Where to Stop)
	c) Updation Part  ( How much to increment / Decrement) '''
