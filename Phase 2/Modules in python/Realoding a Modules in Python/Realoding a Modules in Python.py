__Properties = """
To reload a module in python , we use a pre-defined function called reload(), which is present in imp module and it was
deprecated in favour of importlib module.

Syntax:-	imp.reload(module name)
					(OR)
			importlib.reload(module name) ----->recommended

----------------------------------
=>Purpose / Situation:
-----------------------------------
reload() reloads a previously imported module. 

if we have edited the module source file  by using an external editor and we want to use the changed values/ updated values
/ new version of previously loaded module then we use reload()."""
